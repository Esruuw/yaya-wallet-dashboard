#Solution Overview
I've enhanced the YaYa Wallet Dashboard by adding several new columns to the transaction table and implementing a statistics summary section. The solution includes:
1.Enhanced Backend Data: Added more transaction properties (type, category, date)
2.Additional Table Columns: Type, Category, and Date columns in the transaction table

#Security Considerations
1.CORS Configuration: The backend already has CORS enabled, which is appropriate for development
2.Input Validation: For production, I would add validation middleware to sanitize inputs
3.Environment Variables: Sensitive configuration is properly stored in environment variables

#Testing Instructions
Prerequisites
1.Node.js installed
2.Backend and frontend dependencies installed (npm install in both directories)

#Backend Testing
Navigate to the backend directory
1.Run npm start or node server.js
2.Test the API endpoint:
3.Verify the response includes the enhanced transaction data with new fields

#Frontend Testing
1.Navigate to the frontend directory
2.Run npm start
3.Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser
4.Verify:
-The page loads without errors
-The statistics summary shows three cards with correct calculations
-The transaction table displays all columns (ID, Name, Amount, Type, Category, Date, Status)
-Search functionality works correctly
-Different statuses and types have appropriate styling

#Additional Tests
1.Test with an empty transactions array to verify the "No transactions found" message appears
2.Test search functionality with various inputs
3.Verify that all transaction types (Deposit, Withdrawal, Transfer) have distinct styling
4.Confirm that all statuses (Completed, Pending, Failed) have appropriate color coding

#Sample Enhanced Data Structure
{
  id: 1,
  name: "Esrael",
  amount: 250,
  status: "Completed",
  date: "2025-10-15",
  type: "Deposit",
  category: "Salary"
}
